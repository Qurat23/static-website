<h1>BEAUTIFUL POETRY ABOUT NATURE</h1></br>
<pre>
  <h3><q>The Beauty Of A Tree</q></h3>

Can there be anything more lovely
Than the beauty of a tree?
Her leaves shimmering in the wind,
Dancing so gracefully.

The strength of her mighty roots
That grows deep into the earth.
She's weathered every stormy gale
For all that she is worth.

Standing tall, resilient
With her branches lifted high,
She refused to bow, to break or bend
But reaches upward to the sky.

The beauty of the strength within
As she held her head up high.
Her strong resilient spirit
Grew wings and learned to fly.


<h3><q>A Still Moment</q></h3>

Take a moment.
Put the worries behind.
Take in the beauty around.
Let it relax your mind.

Watch the golden glow
Of the rising morning sun.
Embrace the peaceful aura
Of the break of dawn.

Savor the soft caress
Of the gently moving breeze.
Listen to its nifty tune
Among the swaying trees.

Enjoy the lovely scene
Of a floating butterfly.
Graceful flight and happy tweets
Of a bird perched up high.

Peruse the evening sky
In its dazzling splendor.
The wide and open pallet
Merging shapes and colors.

Relish the loving sight
Of children having fun,
Skipping feet and carefree voices
Under the setting sun.

Spare a still moment
Every once in a while.
Take in the beauty around.
Take it in with a smile.


<h3><q>I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud</q></h3>

I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.


<h3><q>A Time Of Freedom</q></h3>

Morning's soft air, touching everything with such care,
Caresses a young face in a quiet, secluded place.
Smile planted strong, heart beating on.
Only one thing is on her mind, and that is summertime.

A joy reckless and wild,
that's been in the heart of every child,
now set within her,
for there is no cure.
Her spirit set free, soars higher than the trees.

The books that weighed her down,
now thrown on the ground.
The rivers cleansed from winter,
are now heated for splendor.
The happiness of knowing
no bedtimes are set,
and no schedules to be met.
The sun now beating within her veins
washes away all her pains.

Then without a sound,
the sun starts to sink down.
so she heads inside,
satisfied,
until the next time.

But her spirit is just too wild and decides to wait a while,
so it stays outside and watches the sun,
waiting for what is to come.

The birds fall asleep, the peepers start to peep,
and slowly the sunbeams caressing the mountains,
turn them into splendorous fountains.
